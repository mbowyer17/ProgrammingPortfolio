Hello, thanks for reading this!

Just making this a brief explanation

This is a project made at university as more of a tool to be used by Unity Developers to debug and improve work.

It consists of using custom editor scripts to add editor windows that spawns prefabs in to the scene using your mouse.

Npcs were used as prefabs, and I used Editor scripts to display their stats using Gizmos.
