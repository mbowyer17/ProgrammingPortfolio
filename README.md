# ProgrammingPortfolio

Welcome! My Name is Matthew Bowyer, a passionate gameplay programmer with expertise in both Unity (C#) and Unreal (C++). I have a BSc with First Class Honours in Game Design and Development (Programming) at University of Greenwich. I'm Looking for an Intern or Junior position in Gameplay Programming.

ðŸŽ® My Journey

I have been transforming game ideas into engaging interactive experiences for gamers for more than 8 years. I got my start in game development with the game Gmod, where I learned how to use the coding language Lua to create unique gamemodes that players enjoy. I was introduced to Unity in 2016 to adapt the gamemodes I helped create into games,  Ever since, I've been hooked on game development.

ðŸ›  Expertise

I have a thorough understanding of Unity's architectures and intricacies from my considerable experience with it. I intend to transfer my skills between engines, as I'm new to Unreal, in order to adjust to a changing market in game engines. I've done it all, from designing complex gameplay mechanisms in C# for Unity to developing experimental game systems in C++ for Unreal.
