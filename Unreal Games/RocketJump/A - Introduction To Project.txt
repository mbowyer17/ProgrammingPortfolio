Welcome to code base for my game RocketJump!

Link to Game - TBD

Introduction:
The sole means of survival when trapped in a chamber with nothing but a rocket launcher is to outfit yourself with rocket-resistant footwear and use the launcher to avoid the traps.
The quick-fire first-person shooter mechanic from Team Fortress 2 and Quake served as the model for this project. I was surprised that no game was using this idea as the primary feature of their game, as it represented a gap in the market.
To develop this project, I used blueprints and Unreal Engine C++.

Objectives:
- Reaching the end of the puzzles 
- Avoid falling into dead zones

Mechanics:
- Character Controller

- Rocket projectile

- Launch Pad

- Dead Zone  
Outcome/Lessons Learned:
